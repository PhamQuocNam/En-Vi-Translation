       " 'In 4 minutes , atmospheric chemist Rachel Pike provides a glimpse of the massive scientific effort behind the bold headlines on climate change , with her team -- one of thousands who contributed -- taking a risky flight over the rainforest in pursuit of data on a key molecule .',\n",
       " 'I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper .',\n",
       " 'Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change , and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog .',\n",
       " 'They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science .',\n",
       " 'Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , or IPCC , put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system .',\n",
       " 'That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries .',\n",
       " 'They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .',\n",
       " 'And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers , from 113 countries .',\n",
       " 'It &apos;s a big community . It &apos;s such a big community , in fact , that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world .',\n",
       " 'Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that .',\n",
       " 'And every one of those scientists is in a research group , and every research group studies a wide variety of topics .',\n",
       " 'For us at Cambridge , it &apos;s as varied as the El Niño oscillation , which affects weather and climate , to the assimilation of satellite data , to emissions from crops that produce biofuels , which is what I happen to study .',\n",
       " 'And in each one of these research areas , of which there are even more , there are PhD students , like me , and we study incredibly narrow topics , things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules .',\n",
       " 'And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene , which is here . It &apos;s a small organic molecule . You &apos;ve probably never heard of it .',\n",
       " 'The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene .',\n",
       " 'But despite its very small weight , enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet .',\n",
       " 'It &apos;s a huge amount of stuff . It &apos;s equal to the weight of methane .',\n",
       " 'And because it &apos;s so much stuff , it &apos;s really important for the atmospheric system .',\n",
       " 'Because it &apos;s important to the atmospheric system , we go to all lengths to study this thing .',\n",
       " 'We blow it up and look at the pieces .',\n",
       " 'This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain .',\n",
       " 'Atmospheric explosions , or full combustion , takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car .',\n",
       " 'But still , we look at the pieces .',\n",
       " 'We run enormous models on supercomputers ; this is what I happen to do .',\n",
       " 'Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each , on minute timescales .',\n",
       " 'And it takes weeks to perform our integrations .',\n",
       " 'And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what &apos;s happening .',\n",
       " 'We also fly all over the world looking for this thing .',\n",
       " 'I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia . There are others .',\n",
       " 'We found a global atmospheric watchtower there , in the middle of the rainforest , and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower , to look for isoprene , and of course , other things while we were there .',\n",
       " 'This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest , from above .',\n",
       " 'And this is the tower from below .',\n",
       " 'And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us .',\n",
       " 'And this plane , the model , BA146 , which was run by FAAM , normally flies 120 to 130 people .',\n",
       " 'So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today .',\n",
       " 'But we didn &apos;t just fly it . We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff .',\n",
       " 'We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements .',\n",
       " 'We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .',\n",
       " 'We have to get special flight clearance .',\n",
       " 'And as you come around the banks in these valleys , the forces can get up to two Gs .',\n",
       " 'And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they &apos;re on board .',\n",
       " 'So , as you can imagine , the inside of this aircraft doesn &apos;t look like any plane you would take on vacation .',\n",
       " 'It &apos;s a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule .',\n",
       " 'We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .',\n",
       " 'And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule , they write one scientific paper on the subject .',\n",
       " 'And out of that field campaign we &apos;ll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .',\n",
       " 'And as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one subsection , or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC , although we have others .',\n",
       " 'And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections .',\n",
       " 'So you can imagine the scale of the effort .',\n",
       " 'In each one of those assessments that we write , we always tag on a summary , and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience .',\n",
       " 'And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers , in order to make headlines like these .',\n",
